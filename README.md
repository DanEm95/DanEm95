👨‍💻 **Code, ☕ Coffee, and Creative Solutions 🎯**  
As a future computer scientist specializing in application development, I am passionate about transforming complex requirements into elegant software solutions. I emphasize quality, efficiency, and creativity in every line of code. Whether I am hunting bugs or optimizing algorithms, I approach challenges with full commitment and, of course, a cup of coffee. My favorite "superpowers" are **C#**, **Python** and **OpenEdge ABL**, which I use to deliver successful projects.

🖥️ **My journey from 'Hello World' to real software** 🖥️  
During my apprenticeship at CBW (graduating in January 2025), I've learned not only how to write clean code, but also how to understand it - even the code I wrote weeks ago! I've developed applications that solve real-world problems, from small automations to significant optimizations.  
Fun fact: I've discovered that *commenting my code* makes my future self much happier.

🕵️‍♂️ **Debugging - More Than Just Finding Bugs 🐞**  
What excites me most about software development is the mix of creative problem solving and technical precision. Debugging feels like a detective game: challenging, occasionally frustrating, but always rewarding when the last bug is squashed. I thrive on collaboration, enjoy learning new technologies, and constantly push myself to grow. Most importantly, I believe that technology should serve people - and this belief motivates me every day.
