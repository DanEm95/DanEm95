👨‍💻 Code, ☕ Coffee and creative solutions 🎯</br>
As a future computer scientist for application development it is my passion to transform complex requirements into elegant software solutions. In doing so, I put special emphasis on quality, efficiency and a pinch of creativity. Whether it is the hunt for bugs or the optimization of algorithms, I face every challenge with full commitment and a cup of coffee. Technologies like C#, Python, OpenEdge ABL and others are my favorite "super powers" to implement projects successfully.</br>

🖥️ My way from "Hello World" to real software 🖥️</br>
During my apprenticeship at CBW (graduation in mid-January 2025), I not only learned to write clean code, but also to understand it - even the code I wrote a few weeks ago. In various projects I developed applications that not only work, but also solve real problems. This ranged from small automations to big optimizations.
Fun fact: I have already learned that commenting code makes my future much more relaxed.</br>

🕵️‍ Debugging - more than just finding bugs 🐞</br>
What fascinates me about software development is the mix of creative problem solving and technical precision. Debugging is like a detective game for me - challenging and sometimes frustrating, but incredibly satisfying when the last bug is found. I love working with teams, discovering new technologies, and pushing myself. Most of all, I believe that technology can help people - and that motivates me every day.</br>
