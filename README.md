👨‍💻 **Code, ☕ Coffee, and Creative Solutions 🎯**  
As a future computer scientist for application development it is my passion to transform complex requirements into elegant software solutions. In doing so, I put special emphasis on quality, efficiency and a pinch of creativity. Whether it is the hunt for bugs or the optimization of algorithms, I face every challenge with full commitment and a cup of coffee. Technologies like C#, Python, OpenEdge ABL and others are my favorite "super powers" to implement projects successfully.

🖥️ **My journey from 'Hello World' to real software** 🖥️  
During my apprenticeship at CBW (graduating in January 2025), I've learned not only how to write clean code, but also how to understand it - even the code I wrote weeks ago! I've developed applications that solve real-world problems, from small automations to significant optimizations.  
Fun fact: I've discovered that *commenting my code* makes my future self much happier.

🕵️‍♂️ **Debugging - More Than Just Finding Bugs 🐞**  
What excites me most about software development is the mix of creative problem solving and technical precision. Debugging feels like a detective game: challenging, occasionally frustrating, but always rewarding when the last bug is squashed. I thrive on collaboration, enjoy learning new technologies, and constantly push myself to grow. Most importantly, I believe that technology should serve people - and this belief motivates me every day.
