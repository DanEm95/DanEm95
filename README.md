👨‍💻 **Code, ☕ Coffee, and Creative Solutions** 🎯  
As a future computer scientist for application development it is my passion to transform complex requirements into elegant software solutions. In doing so, I put special emphasis on quality, efficiency and a pinch of creativity. Whether it is the hunt for bugs or the optimization of algorithms, I face every challenge with full commitment and a cup of coffee. Technologies like ABL, C#, Python, JavaScript and others are my favorite "super powers" to implement projects successfully.

🖥️ **My journey from 'Hello World' to real software** 🖥️  
During my study, I not only learned to write clean code, but also to understand it, even the code I wrote a few weeks ago. In various projects I developed applications that not only work, but also solve real problems. This ranged from small automations to big optimizations.
Fun fact: I have already learned that commenting code makes my future much more relaxed. 

🕵️‍♂️ **Debugging, More Than Just Finding Bugs** 🐞  
What fascinates me about software development is the mix of creative problem solving and technical precision. Debugging is like a detective game for me, challenging and sometimes frustrating, but incredibly satisfying when the last bug is found. I love working with teams, discovering new technologies, and pushing myself. Most of all, I believe that technology can help people and that motivates me every day.

📨 **Contact Me!** 📨
